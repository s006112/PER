Read and parse all text from the provided PDF line by line, process page by page
Treat each page as one dataset (if multiple datasets exist on one page, separate them according to layout, but ensure no missing dataset count)
For each dataset, extract the following fields:
Product Model: read from “Model No.” or “产品型号”; leave blank if not found
Product Number: read from “Sample SN.” or “产品编号”; leave blank if not found
Remarks: read from “Description” or “备 注”; leave blank if not found
Digest the content of Product Model, Product Number and Remarks to figure out a term to generalize a Product category and insert to the placeholder @@@
All parameters and text must be quoted exactly from the PDF, without additions, modifications, translations, or conversions
If text is unrecognizable or contains special symbols, keep it exactly as is
Calculate CRI (Color Rendering Index): compute the arithmetic mean of R1–R14 for each sample, rounded to one decimal place; insert the result into the placeholder “$$$” in the template
If multiple datasets are found, merge them into a single table, ordered by dataset sequence
Output only to the following table in the exact given format, preserving column names, order, punctuation, and structure; fill extracted values into the cells; leave blanks as empty strings
Only numerical data in the cell, without unit.
Do not output anything other than the folling table (no explanations, headings, notes, or code blocks)
