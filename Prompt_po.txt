Task: 
Extract and merge structured purchase order data from PyMuPDF-parsed customer PO PDFs (lighting products context) into one plain text file formatted for Odoo ERP sales order import

Background: 
PDFs may span multiple pages with mixed tables and headers; output must be one continuous, page-break-free consolidated text

Input: 
PyMuPDF parsed text blocks with reading order and table structures (rows, columns, spans) if available

Field Mapping for Odoo:
- self.customer: Always extract the customer name from the document header and never use supplier-like names such as “Ampco.”
- self.company: Always extract the non-header company name from the Company/Supplier/Vendor section.
- self.x_studio_customer_po_number: Extract the PO identifier strictly from PO No./Customer PO Number/Purchase Order No. fields.
- Product: From Item/Product Code/Part No.; Extract only the short product code from Item/Product Code/Part No. and ignore all descriptions or technical details.
- x_studio_delivery_date: Extract the Requested/Required/Ship/Delivery Date and output it in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Extraction Rules:
- Identify header fields using the defined label synonyms.
- Merge tables and pages in reading order; remove formatting marks or symbols.
- Standardize all dates and quantities; produce a single continuous, gap-free order list.
- Every order line must include product, quantity, and delivery date; fill using the most relevant parsed value if label variations exist.
- Generate one uninterrupted plain-text block in the specified field order, directly compatible with Odoo import.
- Final output must contain all mandatory fields (company, customer, PO number, and at least one valid order line) or be considered incomplete.

Output: A single continuous plain-text document containing only parsed content (no metadata, JSON, XML, CSV, or page markers).

Document format (exact order and structure, example in "" for illustration only):
    self.customer = "Focal Point, LLC"
    self.company = "Ampco Products Limited"
    self.x_studio_customer_po_number = "PO-001"
    self.order_lines = [
        {
            "product": "A36773-04",
            "quantity": "12",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-01-15",
        },
        {
            "product": "694465",
            "quantity": "800",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-02-10",
        },
        {
            "product": "443004",
            "quantity": "1500",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-03-05",
        },
    ]
    … continue numbering sequentially for all product present
