Extract and consolidate structured purchase order data (lighting products trading context) from PyMuPDF-parsed text of customer PO PDFs into a single plain text document formatted for Odoo ERP sales order import
• Background: PDFs may contain multiple pages, mixed tables, headers, and revisions; requirement is a coherent, page-break-free consolidated text
• Input: PyMuPDF parsed text blocks with reading order and table structures (rows, columns, spans) if available
• Output: One continuous plain text document, no metadata/JSON/XML/CSV, no page break markers, no invented data, only parsed content
• Output format (exact order and structure):
- Company: []
- Customer: []
- Salesperson: []
- Order Date: []
- Customer PO Number: []
    - Order Lines/1/Product Template: []
    - Order Lines/1/Quantity: []
    - Order Lines/1/Delivery Date: []
    - Order Lines/2/Product Template: []
    - Order Lines/2/Quantity: []
    - Order Lines/2/Delivery Date: []
    - Order Lines/3/Product Template: []
    - Order Lines/3/Quantity: []
    - Order Lines/3/Delivery Date: []
    … continue numbering sequentially for all order lines present


• Field mapping rules for Odoo:
Product: item name, SKU, or product code (accept aliases Item, Product Code, Part No.), long description excluded
Quantity: numeric only (accept Qty, QTY, Quantity Ordered)
Delivery Date: requested/required/ship/delivery date (map to commitment date in Odoo)
Preserve field order exactly; omit fields not found; do not insert placeholders
• Consolidation rules:
Combine text from all pages in logical reading order
Remove headers, footers, page numbers, and revision notes
Normalize multi-page tables; join wrapped or spanned cells
Maintain consistent section order regardless of original layout
Use one blank line only between header section and order lines
Keep all numbers, dates, and currency symbols as parsed; do not reformat
Exclude totals, tax summaries, or non-item tables

• Extraction guidance:
Identify header fields using synonyms: Company/Supplier/Vendor; Customer/Sold To/Bill To; Salesperson/Sales Rep; Order Date/PO Date; Customer PO Number/PO No.
Detect order line table by common headers: Item, Description, Qty, Unit Price, Tax, Discount, Delivery Date
Exclude marketing text, terms, or attachments
Maintain logical grouping of multi-line item descriptions
• Output rules:
Plain text only, no markup, no delimiters beyond line breaks
Fixed field order and naming as defined
No inferred or guessed data; only parsed text
• Style: Professional, concise, deterministic, and format-strict
