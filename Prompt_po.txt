Task: 
Extract and merge structured purchase order data from PyMuPDF-parsed customer PO PDFs (lighting products context) into one plain text file formatted for Odoo ERP sales order import

Background: 
PDFs may span multiple pages with mixed tables and headers; output must be one continuous, page-break-free consolidated text

Input: 
PyMuPDF parsed text blocks with reading order and table structures (rows, columns, spans) if available

Field Mapping for Odoo:
- Company: Always appeared as "Ampco", or from Company/Supplier/Vendor section.
- Customer: Always appeared in header, or Customer/Sold To/Bill To section
- Customer PO Number: Always from PO No./Customer PO Number/Purchase Order No.
- Product: From Item/Product Code/Part No.; keep only short code, description.
- Quantity: From Qty/QTY/Quantity Ordered; numeric only.
- Delivery Date: From Requested/Required/Ship/Delivery Date; standardize to YYYY-MM-DD.

Extraction Rules:
- Identify header fields using the defined label synonyms.
- Merge tables and pages in reading order; remove formatting marks or symbols.
- Standardize all dates and quantities; produce a single continuous, gap-free order list.
- Every order line must include product, quantity, and delivery date; fill using the most relevant parsed value if label variations exist.
- Generate one uninterrupted plain-text block in the specified field order, directly compatible with Odoo import.
- Final output must contain all mandatory fields (company, customer, PO number, and at least one valid order line) or be considered incomplete.

Additional data rules:
- The value of self.customer must never be "Ampco" or any variation of it; if such a value appears, treat it as a mix-up between company and customer names—use other contextual clues to correctly identify the customer
- If the text includes ‘Good Earth Lighting’, assign it to self.customer.

Output: 
Output: A single continuous plain-text document containing only parsed content (no metadata, JSON, XML, CSV, or page markers).

Output format (exact order and structure, example in "" for illustration only):
    self.company = "Ampco Products Limited"
    self.customer = "Focal Point, LLC"
    self.x_studio_customer_po_number = "PO-001"
    self.order_lines = [
        {
            "product": "A36773-04",
            "quantity": "12",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-01-15",
        },
        {
            "product": "694465",
            "quantity": "800",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-02-10",
        },
        {
            "product": "443004",
            "quantity": "1500",
            "x_studio_delivery_date": "2025-03-05",
        },
    ]
    … continue numbering sequentially for all product present
