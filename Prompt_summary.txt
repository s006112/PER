Analyze the product category table and remarks dataset to produce the following outputs:
• Begin with, concise, professional English bullet-point-form-summarizing in detail the photometric numerical performance
• Follow with a structured list with subtopic ### that includes:
　- "Outstanding performance metrics": clearly demonstrate strong results
　- "Abnormal values, outliers, or inconsistencies": such as sudden drops, unusually high/low readings, or irregular distribution patterns
　- "Deviations": Any metrics deviation from expected standards, benchmarks, or design specifications
• all list points should be replaced by checkboxes symbol - [ ]
• Ensure the tone is professional, technical, precise, and focused on clarity
• Structure the point list so that critical anomalies are highlighted distinctly from normal performance data
• Do not use three-dash markdown horizontal rules
• Provide only the requested summary and list without additional remarks or reasoning
